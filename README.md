# automated-teller-machine (ATM)
Group University Project, for CS 3304 Algorithms & Data Structures, with the goal to develop a software that acts as an ATM machine with OOP.

# About
The broader scope of this project is to practice and showcase our understanding of Object Oriented Programming. More specifically, the use of encapsulation and base class inheritence. We aim at creating an ATM software which has the following features to both a 'Savings' and a 'Checking' account: *Deposit, Widthdraw, and CheckBalance*. And, the use of OOP provides layered security for the users information.
